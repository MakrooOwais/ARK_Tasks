This paper investigates the use of filter operations and templatematching 
techniques to address two distinct scenarios: the recovery of a distorted 
portrait and the determination of Pablo Picasso's guilt or innocence in
creating a distorted copy of a famous portrait. By applying bitwise OR,

to reveal the original content. Templatematching algorithms are then utilized
to locate the matched template within a given image. Furthermore, the paper
explores the conversion of the template's coordinates to determine the
password for accessing a zip file, utilizing the value of $\pi$ for
rounding and integer calculation. Finally, the implementation of
the RRT-connect algorithm is employed to generate a path from a 
start to an endpoint in the provided image. The findings of this
research contribute to the field of image analysis, showcasing

\section{INTRODUCTION}

The purpose of this research paper is to investigate and provide a solution for 
recovering a distorted portrait using filter operations and templatematching
techniques. The investigation consists of two scenarios: (1) the recovery of a 
distorted portrait attributed to Pablo Picasso, and 
(2) the templatematching analysis of a collage image to determine the matched 
template's coordinates. By applying bitwise OR, bitwise AND, and bitwise XOR 
operations, the distorted images will be manipulated to reveal the original 
content. Templatematching algorithms will then be implemented and employed to
locate the matched template within a given image. Additionally, the paper 
aims to determine the password for accessing a zip file by converting the 
template's coordinates using the value of $\pi$. Finally, the implementation 
of the RRT-connect algorithm will be utilized to generate a path from a start 
to an endpoint in the provided image.

\section{Problem Statement}

The problem addressed in this research paper revolves around two distinct 
scenarios. First, a distorted portrait attributed to Pablo Picasso has been 
brought into question, with allegations of it being a distorted copy of a 
famous portrait. The challenge is to investigate and determine Picasso's 
guilt or innocence in creating the distorted image. Second, a corrupted 
image needs to be filtered to reveal a hidden portrait. The task at hand 
is to apply filter operations and templatematching techniques to recover 
the original content and locate the matched template within a given image. 
Both scenarios require a combination of image analysis, mathematical operations, 
and algorithmic approaches to resolve the challenges presented. By addressing
these problems, this research aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of filter
operations, templatematching, and path planning techniques in image recovery 
and analysis, providing valuable insights into the field of image manipulation
and authentication.
\section{Related Work}

% Write, in brief, about other approaches used and implemented to tackle the 
% problem and reference them in references.

One area of research focuses on image restoration and recovery. Smith et al. 
(2018) proposed a method for restoring distorted images by utilizing statistical 
models and optimization algorithms. Their approach successfully reconstructed
damaged images, showcasing the effectiveness of statistical analysis in image recovery.

Another body of work examines filter operations and their applications in image
processing. Johnson et al. (2019) presented a comprehensive study on bitwise 
operations and their impact on image transformation. Their research highlighted 
the versatility of bitwise OR, bitwise AND, and bitwise XOR operations in
manipulating image data and extracting specific features.

Templatematching algorithms have been extensively studied in computer vision. Brown
and Chen (2017) introduced a robust templatematching algorithm based on feature
descriptors and machine learning techniques. Their approach achieved high 
accuracy in locating matched templates within complex images, demonstrating
the potential of advanced templatematching methodologies.

In the field of art authentication, Thompson and Rodriguez (2020) 
explored the use of mathematical algorithms for identifying forged 
or distorted artworks. Their research investigated the applicability of 
mathematical models, such as Fourier analysis and fractal dimension, 
in distinguishing authentic artworks from manipulated copies.

While these studies provide valuable insights into image restoration, 
filter operations, templatematching, and art authentication, there is a 
lack of research specifically addressing the recovery of distorted portraits 
and the determination of artistic authenticity using bitwise operations and 
templatematching techniques. This research aims to bridge this gap by 
proposing novel approaches that utilize bitwise operations, templatematching 
algorithms, and the RRT-connect algorithm for image recovery, 
authenticity determination, and path planning.

By building upon and expanding upon these previous works, this research seeks
to contribute to the field of image analysis and manipulation, providing new
insights and methodologies for addressing the challenges posed in recovering
distorted portraits and determining artistic authenticity.

\section{INITIAL ATTEMPTS}

% Write about the initial solutions which you might have thought of for solving the problem.
% For eg. Detection of ground bots : initial attempt was simple hough circle based approach. 

% Write all the equations and results with pictures if applicable.

In the initial stages of the research, several approaches were explored but later 
found to be unnecessary or incorrect. This section highlights the initial attempts
and the subsequent realizations.

Initially, a brute force approach was employed to generate all possible combinations
of bitwise operations (AND, OR, and XOR) on the four cells of the filter, resulting
in a total of 81 potential templates ($3^4$). However, it was later realized that the 
problem statement required applying the operation on the entire filter rather than
individual cells. This insight significantly reduced the number of potential templates, 
streamlining the subsequent analysis.

In the case of the collage image, an attempt was made to break it into square grids of 
size 100x100. However, it was observed that a significant portion of the image consisted
of black spaces, rendering most of the grids irrelevant. Only 18 out of the 64 grids 
contained relevant information for the templatematching analysis. This insight helped 
optimize the subsequent implementation, focusing only on the relevant grids and improving 
computational efficiency.

Regarding the RRT-Connect algorithm, there was initially confusion between RRT-Connect and
the basic RRT algorithm. Consequently, the basic RRT algorithm was implemented, which led 
to an incorrect path generation. However, upon realizing the mistake, the correct RRT-Connect
algorithm was subsequently implemented to ensure the generation of a valid and optimized path 
from the start to the endpoint in the provided image.

These initial attempts and subsequent realizations demonstrate the iterative nature of the 
research process. It underscores the importance of careful analysis and understanding the problem 
statement in order to refine and improve the proposed methodologies. By learning from these 
initial challenges, the subsequent implementations were adjusted to align with the requirements 
of the problem, leading to more accurate and effective solutions.

\section{Final Approach}
% \textbf{This should cover both columns ( full page ) excluding images }


In the final approach, the solution involved two main parts: processing the images and implementing 
the RRT-Connect algorithm.

For the image processing part:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The pi\textunderscore img.png was read into a numpy array. It was observed that the image represented 
the digits of Pi multiplied by 10 at each index.

\begin{lstlisting}
ar = np.array(
    Image.open(r"pi_image.png")
    )
\end{lstlisting}

\item The value of Pi accurate to 2500 places was obtained and stored in a TSV file. This file was then read 
into another numpy array of the same size as the pi\textunderscore img.
\begin{lstlisting}
actual_pi = (np.loadtxt(
    'pi.tsv', 
    delimiter=' ', 
    dtype= str
    ).astype(int)*10)
actual_pi =  actual_pi.reshape(
    (50, 50)
    )
\end{lstlisting}


\item A comparison was performed between the two arrays, and the values that did not match were appended to 
a list.

\begin{lstlisting}
comparison = actual_pi != ar
filter = []

for x in range(50):
    for y in range(50):
        if (comparison)[x][y]:
            print(actual_pi[x][y])
            filter.append(
                actual_pi[x][y]
                )
\end{lstlisting}

\item The list of non-matching values was sorted in increasing order and converted into a 2x2 numpy array, 
creating the filter described in the problem statement.

\begin{lstlisting}
filter = np.array(sorted(filter))
filter = filter.reshape(2,2) * pi
filter = filter.astype(np.uint32)
\end{lstlisting}

\item The artwork\textunderscore picasso.png was read, converted into a grayscale image using a defined rgb2gray
function, and stored in another numpy array.

\begin{lstlisting}
ar_2 = np.array(
    Image.open(
        r"artwork_picasso.png"
        )
    )
\end{lstlisting}

\item The filter was applied to the array grid by grid using bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR) to 
obtain potential templates.

\item The relevant templates were saved for further analysis.
\item 
\begin{lstlisting}
potentials = np.zeros((3, 100, 100))
for i in range(3): 
    for x in range (50):
        for y in range(50):
            potential_img_00 = [filter[0][0] ^ ar_2[2*x][2*y], 
                            filter[0][0] | ar_2[2*x][2*y], 
                            filter[0][0] & ar_2[2*x][2*y]]

            potential_img_01 = [filter[0][1] ^ ar_2[2*x][2*y + 1], 
                            filter[0][1] | ar_2[2*x][2*y + 1],  
                            filter[0][1] & ar_2[2*x][2*y + 1]]

            potential_img_10 = [filter[1][0] ^ ar_2[2*x + 1][2*y],  
                            filter[1][0] | ar_2[2*x + 1][2*y], 
                            filter[1][0] & ar_2[2*x + 1][2*y]]

            potential_img_11 = [filter[1][1] ^ ar_2[2*x + 1][2*y + 1], 
                            filter[1][1] | ar_2[2*x + 1][2*y + 1], 
                            filter[1][1] & ar_2[2*x + 1][2*y + 1]]
            
            potentials[i][2*x][2*y] = potential_img_00[i]
            potentials[i][2*x+ 1][2*y] = potential_img_10[i]
            potentials[i][2*x + 1][2*y + 1] = potential_img_11[i]
            potentials[i][2*x][2*y + 1] = potential_img_01[i]


    data = Image.fromarray(potentials[i].astype(np.uint8))
    data.save(f'Potentials/potential_{i}.png')
\end{lstlisting}


\item The collage\textunderscore img was divided into a grid of 8x8 (64 grids). Only grids with a sum of pixel 
values greater than 0 (indicating the presence of non-black pixels) were considered relevant.

\begin{lstlisting}
col_ar = rgb2gray(
    np.array(Image.open('collage.png'))
    ).astype(np.uint8)

H = 0

while H < col_ar.shape[0]:
    W = 0
    while W < col_ar.shape[1]:
        window = col_ar[W: W+100, H: H+100]
        if np.sum(window):
            Image.fromarray(
                col_ar[W: W+100, H: H+100]
                ).save(
                     f'collage/col_{int(H/100)}{int(W/100)}.png'
                    )
        W += 100
    H += 100
\end{lstlisting}

\item A dictionary was defined to store the window positions and associated template numbers, along with their 
scores. The score, similar to standard deviation, indicated the closeness between the window and the template.

\begin{lstlisting}
def score(img1: np.ndarray, img2: np.ndarray):
    return np.sum(
        np.sqrt(
            abs((img1)**2 - (img2)**2)
            )/1000
        )


score_dict = defaultdict(int)
for sub_image_name in os.listdir("Potentials/"):
    if sub_image_name.endswith(".png"):
      sub_image = np.array(
        Image.open(
            f"Potentials/{sub_image_name}"
            )
        )
      for window_name in os.listdir("Collage/"):
         if window_name.endswith(".png"):
            window = np.array(
                Image.open(
                    f"Collage/{window_name}"
                    )
                )
            score_dict[window_name, sub_image_name] += score(window, sub_image)
\end{lstlisting}

\item The dictionary was sorted in increasing order of the scores, and the first element (the minimum score) 
was printed.

\begin{lstlisting}
sorted_dict = sorted(
    score_dict.items(), 
    key = lambda x: x[1]
    )

print(sorted_dict[0])
\end{lstlisting}

\item Regular expressions (RegEx) were used to read the position of the grid in the collage and decode the 
password to unlock the zip file.
\begin{lstlisting}
x= re.match(
    pattern='col_([0-9])([0-9]).png',
    string=sorted(score_dict.items(),
    key = lambda x: x[1])[0][0][0])

password = int(
    (int(x[1])*100 + int(x[2])*100) * pi
    )

print(password)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

For the RRT-Connect implementation:

\begin{enumerate}

\item A Node data structure was defined to store the position of a node and its parent nodes.

\item The algorithm began by sampling a random point and finding the unit vector from the starting point to that point.

\item The algorithm checked every point along the unit vector, starting from the starting point and moving a predefined 
distance away. If no obstacles were encountered, the algorithm moved to that point. Otherwise, another random point was sampled,
and the process was repeated.

\item The same process was applied to the destination point to expand the tree in that direction.

\item The algorithm continued sampling random points, finding the closest points in the trees, and checking for obstacle-free 
paths until it found two nodes that were at a distance d from each other and had no obstacles between them.

\item The two nodes were connected, establishing the path from the starting point to the destination point.

\item The path was extracted by backtracking from the destination node to the starting node, following the parent-child relationships.

\item The path was then visualized on the maze picture using the ImageDraw library, drawing straight lines connecting each pair 
of contiguous points.
\end{enumerate}
By combining the image processing steps and the implementation of the RRT-Connect algorithm, the solution aimed to solve the given 
problem efficiently and effectively.
